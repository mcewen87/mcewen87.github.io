          <h2>Experience</h2>
          <p>Thanks for visiting my portfolio website. You are most likely here to better understand my background and experience as a developer and project manager, so let's cover those topics.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a developer, I find myselfÂ inspired by multiple concerns. In other words, I love data structures and algorithms as much as I love web design. Over the past five years, I've worked with Ember, React, Express, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a project manager, I'm committed to task management, clear communication, improving business practices, and helping clients succeed. I've worked professionally as a project manager for over a year.</p>
      
          <p>That's a high-level look at my experience writing code and driving discovery meetings. Outside the world of tech, I have a background in the humanities. I went to college for philosophy and graduate school for creative writing. These endeavors improve my ability to think critically, solve problems, generate ideas, and of course, write emails.</p>
          <p>
            Lastly, for over ten years I worked in the service and hospitality industries, where I gained a deep appreciation for teamwork, patience, customer service, and breakfast tacos.
          </p>

              We built our beta application with three main technologies:
              Ember.JS, Firebase, and Stripe. I'm the Co-Founder of Mentrs and

            <p>
              Eaterly is small front-end application for helping you decide where to eat. I thought of it years ago and finally got around to building it. I used hooks instead of class components.

             Wozz is a full-stack application for managing habits and taking notes. It's built on Gatsby.js, Express, and MongoDB. Originally, I handled session management with a cross-domain API, but that proved to be more work than necessary because mobile browsers default to denying third-party-cookies.

            <p>Wozz is a work in progress, but I'm happy with the initial application.</p>

            <p>
             Template Maker is a simple React application that iterates over one or more lists of data to create templates. I used it to generate snippets of HTML from Excel Data. One obvious enhancement would be to add support for multi-word strings.

              can only be 350 words long. And a user can only comment on an
              intuition once. Rush is a full-stack application built with

              Nobody Really Likes is a simple voting app. Users submit entries
              for things that "nobody really likes" and then vote on those
              entries. NRL is a work in progress, and I work on it when I can.
              Adding features has become particularly rewarding because, with
              each addition, the app grows closer to my original vision.

              I wanted to learn GraphQL but I needed data to query. Instead of
              building something meaningless, I decided to cannibalize an old
              writing project from my early twenties. Ten Years Later is a
              digital interface for journal entries from my summer in 2008. I
              wrote a very simply GraphQL server with Express and used React for
              the front-end.
