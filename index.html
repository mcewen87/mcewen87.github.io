                I'm a web developer, the Co-Founder of Mentrs, and a former MFA Creative writing candidate. I've worked with Ember, React/Redux, Node/Express,MongoDB, and most recently GraphQL/Prisma.
                <br></br>
                As a developer, I'm interested in learning more about state management with Redux, algorithms and data structures, and backend development with Node/Express and the GraphQL ecosystem. Additionally, I love building User Interfaces and finding solutions for User
                Experience challenges.
                <br></br>
                Outside of development, I'm interested in literature, Spanish, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, vlogging, and coffee. I'm currently reading "Sunshine State" by Sarah Gerad and writing a narrative non-fiction piece about founding Mentrs and living in North Austin.
                <br></br>
                You'll find plenty of information here about the things I've built.

            <h2><a class="bigLink" href="https://mentrs.com/"> Mentrs</a></h2>
         


            <h3>Technologies:  <span> Ember + Firebase + Stripe </span></h3>



            <p> Mentrs is an open marketplace for online and in-person education. We built our beta application with three main technologies: Ember.JS, Firebase, and Stripe. I'm the Co-Founder of Mentrs and helped build it from the ground up, from idea to deployment. </p>
            <h3>Challenges and Notes:</h3>
            <h4>
                VISIONS OF DEMOCRATIZED INFORMATION
                </h4>
                <p>After a year of independent study of web development, I felt I needed to learn with a community of aspiring developers. To do this, I started a digital boot camp. I quickly realized most anything could be learned outside the walls of an institution. More importantly, I realized that everyone has something to teach and something to learn. Mentrs was born directly out of these revelations. </p>
                <h4>
                   CUTTING MY FRONT-END TEETH
                    </h4>
                    <p> I wrote a significant portion of Mentrs' codebase with the help of a few really talented Ember Developers. When we typed out "ember new ..." in the console, I already new HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but I had never built an application.</p>
                    <p> My initial contributions to the project were primarily writing HTML and CSS - which was quite fitting since I had to not only design the application's UI but also make a handful of critical UX decisions.</p>
                    <p>As time went on, I began working on the application on my own, adding features like geo location, blogging and commenting, and real-time notifications.</p>
                <h4>

            <h2><a class="bigLink" href="https://nrl-app.herokuapp.com/"> Nobody Really Likes</a> </h2>
            <h3>Technologies: <span>Node + Express + React + MongoDB</span></h3>
            <p>
                Nobody Really Likes is a simple voting app. Users submit entries for things that "nobody really likes" and then vote on those entries. NRL is a work in progress, and I work on it when I can. Adding features has become particularly rewarding because, with
                each addition, the app grows closer to my original vision.
            </p>
            <h3>Challenges and Notes: </h3>
            <h4>
  TRACKING VOTES
  </h4>
            <p>
                I needed a way to track votes without forcing users to create accounts. At first, I thought I could store IP addresses, but that proved unreliable. The IP addresses changed too frequently. Ultimately, I used cookies to store random numbers for each visitor.
                That way, a visitor can only vote on an entry once.
            </p>
            <h4>
  MAINTAING ENTRY QUALITY
  </h4>
            <p>
                I needed a way to 1) keep inappropriate entries from flooding the list, and 2) make sure entries were clever, thought-provoking, or humorous. To solve both issues at the same time, I added a cron job that runs on a weekly schedule to delete low-performing
                entries. The function first calculates the median number of votes for the bottom half of the entry list, then it deletes any entries that are over a week old whose vote count is lower than the median.

  </h2>
  <h3>Technologies:  <span> Express + GraphQL </span></h3>
           
            <p>
                I wanted to learn GraphQL but I needed data to query. Instead of building something meaningless, I decided to cannibalize an old writing project from my early twenties.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ten Years Later is a digital interface for journal entries from my summer in 2008. I wrote a very simply GraphQL server with Express and used React for the front end.
            </p>
            <h3>
  Challenges and Notes:
  </h3>
            <h4>
   LEARNING ON THE FLY
  </h4>
            <p>
                GraphQL explanations can be hard to follow because they typically begin with descriptions of the query syntax and no accompanying description of how those queries are resolved on the back end. To get a better understanding of how everything fits together,
                I needed a small project to build as a starting point. This is the outcome of that need. Once I had the basics, I dove deeper with GraphQL and Prisma. 
            </p>
            <h4>
  ALL THINGS DESIGN
  </h4>
            <p>
                I wanted to build a website that had a modern design and an interesting user interface. I liked the aesthetic of evenly dividing the viewport into four rectangular sections and juxtaposing each with white space, hero images, and solid colors. I started
                with a basic checkerboard design and then filled in each section with the appropriate content.
            </p>
            <p>
                I displayed the writing in the middle of the viewport in a traditional material design card. At the bottom of the card, I added previous and next buttons to move through my journal entries by sending graphQL queries to my graphQL server. To improve my
                user experience, I added faded-out classes to the corresponding button when the user was either at the beginning of the array or end of the array.
